For Persistent Bottom Sheet:
1) Use the class 'PersistentSheetActivity.java' and the layout files 'activity_persistent_sheet.xml'
and 'persistent_bottom_sheet.xml'.
2) From these files we will get a basic working Persistent Bottom Sheet along with the following provisions:
a. The bottom sheet will to changed to state collapsed from hidden state on a swipe up gesture.
(Do make a decision on keep this feature in 2.a or not, since we trigger the Bottom Sheet by a designated click or
some other way anyways)
b. The bottom sheet will change state from collapsed to expanded state with click on it.
3) Do make sure to check if the flag 'app:behavior_hideable' in 'persistent_bottom_sheet.xml' file needs to be
set to 'true' meaning the Persistent Bottom Sheet can be hidden at the bottom of the screen OR 'false' meaning
the Persistent Bottom Sheet cannot be hidden at the bottom of the screen.

For Modal Bottom Sheet:
1) Use the classes 'ModalSheetActivity.java' and 'ModalSheetDialog.java' and the layout files
'activity_modal_sheet.xml'and 'modal_bottom_sheet.xml'.
2) Along with these files we are using the 'bottom_sheet_background.xml' files for rounded corners and wiring it in the
'themes.xml' files for it work
3) Also parent="Theme.MaterialComponents.DayNight.BottomSheetDialog" the theme till 'DayNight' which we are extending from
is the same as the parent of the App's main theme. So we should prefer to keep it same with that
